collision detection (player & ball)

	circletype is: player | ball

	(method)detector goes through 360 degrees,

//wall collision
	if(detector hits any wall line)
	//wall collision detected
	compute tan and cot to find the degree accordingly.
	if(our circle is: ball)
	result in wall collision
	else if(our circle is: player)
	result in stopping any force which is orthogonal to the colliding wall

//C2C collision
	if(circle to circle collision is: sqrt(sqrt(x1-x2)+sqrt(y1-y2)))
	//either player to player or ball to player collision detected
	compute tan and cot to find the degree accordingly.
